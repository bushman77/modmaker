StringInfo

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_TURRETS"

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONMOREINFO"
	Value "Turrets have a 360 degree firing arc, but cannot change position in space. This makes them best for covering general areas of your gravity wells from enemies where you've concentrated your other structures."
StringInfo

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_MINEBUILD"

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_MINEPLACEMENT"
	Value "Mines can be placed anywhere within your gravity well. To be most effective, they should be placed near to structures since enemy vessels will move to attack them. Build a minefield near your other structures now."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEINTRO"
	Value "Ultimately, the best way to protect your planets is with an Outpost or a Starbase. Outposts are smaller than Starbases but are cheaper to deploy and well armed. A Starbase is a very large space-metropolis that can stand unaided against even large hostile forces."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEINFO"
	Value "Outposts and Starbases are deployed through specialised construction ships built from a shipyard. Starbases cannot move once deployed, so it's important to build the base exactly where you want it."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEBUILD"
